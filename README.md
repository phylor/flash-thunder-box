# Flash Thunder Box

An easy way to determine the distance of a storm is the "flash-to-bang" method. It calculates the distance of a storm using the seconds passing between flash and thunder.

The Flash Thunder Box calculates that distance for you. It consists of a button which can be pressed twice (first time when the flash is spotted, second time when the thunder is being heard) and displays the approximate distance to the storm.
